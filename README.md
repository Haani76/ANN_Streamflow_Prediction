# ANN Streamflow Prediction

This repository contains the source code for exploring the effectiveness of different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures for streamflow prediction.

## Description
We tested 125 different ANN models by changing:
- Hidden layers and neurons
- Activation functions (ReLU, ELU, SELU, TAnh, SGD)
- Optimizers (Adam, SGD, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adagrad)
